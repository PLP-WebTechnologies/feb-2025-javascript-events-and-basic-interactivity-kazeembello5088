Thanks for sharing this GitHub repository overview. It looks like you're working on a JavaScript event handling and interactivity assignment as part of the PLP Web Technologies classroom for February 2025. The structure and expectations are clearly laid out, including:

Key Tasks:

Implement event listeners (clicks, hovers, keypresses, etc.)

Create interactive UI components (buttons, slideshows, tabs)

Add form validation logic

Include bonus features like animations and hidden actions


If you're looking for help, I can assist you with:

Writing or debugging your script.js

Designing interactive elements in index.html

Adding styling via style.css

Explaining how to implement specific features


Would you like help starting one of the features, or do you have a specific part you're stuck on?
